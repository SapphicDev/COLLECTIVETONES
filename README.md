# About COLLLECTIVETONES
The aim of this project is to create a source for color codes of specific colors so that web designers, web developers, and digital artists no longer have to search to death to find the corresponding codes.

## Why even do this?
Anyone who has ever looked for a digital color code for very specific colors knows what an effort it can be. Especially since almost everything is hidden behind a paywall these days, we want to create a website where all the things creative people need are available in one place.

## Introducing a new naming convention to unify the looks
As we will introduce a new naming convention we will provide a possebilty to simply find the matching color to an existing proprietary system.
### The new convention:
- The major American Company, that endes in one:
    - The Solid Series:
        - for the coated ones: _"COLLECTIVETONES 00000 PSC"_ _(the '00000' bundle of numbers is the code for each color)_
        - fot the uncoated ones: _"COLLECTIVETONES 00000 PSU"_ _(the '00000' bundle of numbers is the code for each color)_
- The German Company, thats  name contains A,L,R.
    - The Classic Series:
        - _"COLLECTIVETONES 0000 RC"_ _(the '00000' bundle of numbers is the code for each color)_
    - The Design+ Series
      - _"COLLECTIVETONES 0000 RD"_ _(the '00000' bundle of numbers is the code for each color)_
    - The Effect Series
      - _"COLLECTIVETONES 0000 RE"_ _(the '00000' bundle of numbers is the code for each color)_
