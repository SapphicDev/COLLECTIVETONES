# About COLLLECTIVETONES
The aim of this project is to create a source for color codes of specific colors so that web designers, web developers, and digital artists no longer have to search to death to find the corresponding codes.

## Why even do this?
Anyone who has ever looked for a digital color code for very specific colors knows what an effort it can be. Especially since almost everything is hidden behind a paywall these days, we want to create a website where all the things creative people need are available in one place.
